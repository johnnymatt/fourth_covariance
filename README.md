1. A digital test signal is generated consisting of 4 random sine waves with frequencies f0, 2f0, 3f0 and 4f0, with constant amplitudes  

2. The discrete Fourier transform and discrete power spectral density (PSD) of the test signal are calculated

3. The fourth covariance in five-dimensional space is computed on a synthetic digital signal: the test signal with added  white noise (signal/noise ratio 30dB). 

Note: The combined digital signal is divided into I non-overlapping time domain segments.
